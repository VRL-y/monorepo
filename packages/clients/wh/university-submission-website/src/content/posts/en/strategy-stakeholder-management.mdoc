Lectures 3 and 4 emphasized a crucial insight: risk management cannot be separated from strategy development. The interconnection between strategic objectives, risk appetite, and stakeholder expectations forms the foundation of any effective risk management.  
What particularly struck me was the idea of risk management as a 'service provider' for strategic decision-making. The goal is not to prevent risks at all costs, but to understand them so thoroughly that the company can take *the right risks*â€”those that are aligned with the strategy and offer a corresponding opportunity. This moves risk management away from a purely preventative function and towards a value-creating one.  
A personal experience that highlighted this was a project where the management was considering entering a new, volatile market. A classic risk analysis would have primarily highlighted the numerous reasons against it. A strategic risk analysis, however, balanced these risks against the immense potential for growth and market leadership. The discussion then shifted from 'How can we avoid these risks?' to 'What level of risk are we willing to accept for this opportunity, and how can we actively manage this risk portfolio?'  
This perspective has fundamentally changed my approach. I no longer see my role as that of a 'guardian' who protects the company from the outside world, but rather as a 'navigator' who helps chart a course through a complex and uncertain environment. This requires a much deeper understanding of the business model and the strategic goals. In the future, I will start every risk assessment with the question: 'How does this decision support our long-term strategy?'
management approach.
