Lectures 5 and 6 took us deeper into two fundamental aspects that I believe are often underestimated in traditional risk management approaches: the role of culture and the nature of uncertainty itself.  
The discussion about risk culture as the 'values, beliefs, knowledge, attitudes, and understanding about risk' truly resonated with me. It’s the 'how we do things around here' when it comes to dealing with what might go wrong—or right. The most important insight for me was that risk culture cannot be simply decreed; it must be actively shaped and exemplified by leadership.  
In my experience, the 'tone at the top' is decisive. I once worked for a partner who responded to the identification of a significant audit risk not with annoyance, but with the question: 'Great find. What can we learn from this, and how does it help our client?' This proactive, learning-oriented approach to risk is the epitome of a healthy risk culture and stands in stark contrast to a purely compliance-driven, 'tick-the-box' mentality.  
My central takeaway is that I must see myself not just as a risk analyst, but also as a culture-shaper. My task is not only to implement processes but also to foster an environment where open communication about risks is encouraged and seen as a strength. In the future, I will pay much more attention to the 'soft factors': How is risk discussed in meetings? How are errors handled? Is there a willingness to take calculated risks? These are the questions that reveal the true risk maturity of an organization, far more than any risk manual ever could.
