The discussion in Lectures 5 and 6 prompted a new line of thinking for me. As methods like FMEA were already familiar from my undergraduate studies, my attention was drawn less to the tools themselves and more to a fundamental question raised in the course: Can we, and should we, use the same techniques to manage downside risks as we do to pursue upside opportunities? This led me to consider the inherent asymmetry between them, which I have visualized in the "Asymmetrical Scale" illustration.

This asymmetry is particularly evident when considering *Black Swans*. These rare, high-impact events, which are often rationalized in hindsight as if they were predictable, cannot be managed with standard analytical tools. The potential for a single catastrophic event often outweighs the benefit of numerous small, incremental opportunities, demanding a focus on building systemic resilience against the unpredictable.

A central takeaway for me is that an effective *IROM system* must be ambidextrous. It requires both a defensive, meticulous "engineering" mindset for known operational risks and a flexible, visionary "explorer" mindset for opportunities. Crucially, it must be designed to withstand the asymmetrical impact of unpredictable events, rather than assuming risks and opportunities are merely two sides of a symmetrical coin.
